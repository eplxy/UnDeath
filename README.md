# UnDeath
a zombie game with a twist! gain a chance at redemption after dying as a human by reaping souls with a might scythe!

created for conuhacks VIII using Unity and C#.

as this was our first hackathon, we made the mistake of not setting up version control early on, so uploading the source code to github was problematic.

## Inspiration
Undeath was inspired by the challenge proposed by Beenox. They had proposed to create a simple 2d zombie shooter video game upon which we added our own twist. Firstly, we were able to add a fantasy side to it by incorporating the character of death, and his revival mechanics added an additional layer to the gameplay, switching the mechanics and purpose of the character, without overcomplicating the game itself. Our team put a lot of effort into the animations and sprites of the character of death, giving him a lot of personality and character within the game. Each major phase or state comes with its own unique animation and overall adds to the lighthearted feel of a contrastingly dark themed game. Although the game can initially be seen as a more "gory", the sprites and gameplay itself can be described as "cute" which is a contrast we were fond of.

## What it does
“Undeath” is a video game where the goal is simply to slay as many zombies as possible before dying. You play as Death armed with a pistol and are tasked with slaying the undead. If you do happen to die to the zombies however, you come back as the ghost of death where you can use a scythe to slay additional zombies. If you are able to slay a certain amount of the undead within a given timeframe, you are able to come back to life, and continue playing the game, hence the name, “undeath”.

## How we built it
Undeath was primarily built with unity, and the sprites and art were made in an online art tool called Pixilart.

## Challenges we ran into
This project actually ended up posing a lot of challenges which were in due mostly to our lack of experience in the domain. Toward the middle of the time, around 11 pm, the entire project failed and code that was previously working had ceased to completely, which was quite devastating and demotivating. ... Another issue we ran into was the integration of the animations and sprites into the game, which were a lot less straightforward than simply implementing the sprites of each frame. This posed an issue as implementing all the animations we had expected to, actually takes much longer than intended.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of a number of accomplishments we were able to make. This was our teams first hackathon, so not only did we not really have experience in this domain but just also in general in the functionning of an event like this, but it ended up working out in the end. Going into this not knowing how this would work at all though, and having pushed through the entire way with an admittedly very gruesome allnighter, we ended up with a game that worked, albeit not with every feature that we were hoping to implement, but still functional and pretty solid looking. I think everyone in our team did a very solid effort and is proud of what we were able to accomplish despite such a steep setback of basically having to restart halfway through it.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Unity, animations, integration, git, hackathons in general and just project management in general.
